# utility_bill_processor
This project uses the Landing.AI Python library to parse and extract data from Greek utility bills. This may be part of a larger workflow, that stores the extracted data in a database, in order to perform data analysis. Although the package was tested using greek utility bills, foreign utility bills should also be processed.

Please note that the VISION_AGENT_API_KEY environment variable must be set to the API key value in order for the Landing.AI python library to work.
